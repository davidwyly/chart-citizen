# Project Context

This is a Next.js application for visualizing and interacting with celestial systems using Three.js and React Three Fiber.

## Key Directories

- `app/`: Next.js application routes and pages
- `components/`: React components for the user interface
- `engine/`: Core rendering and simulation engine
- `lib/`: Shared utilities and types
- `__tests__/`: Test files
- `public/`: Static assets
- `styles/`: Global styles and CSS modules

## Project Structure Rules

1. Each directory should have its own `context.md` file
2. New files should be added to the appropriate directory's `context.md`
3. When a file's purpose changes, update its description in `context.md`
4. Follow the established patterns for file organization
5. Keep related files together in appropriate directories

## Development Guidelines

1. Use TypeScript for all new code
2. Follow the established testing patterns
3. Document complex logic and components
4. Keep components and utilities focused and single-purpose
5. Maintain clear separation of concerns
6. Follow the project's coding style and conventions
7. Do NOT introduce full-screen post-processing passes (chromatic aberration, bloom, etc.) â€” all effects must be object-level.

## Getting Started

1. Read the context files in each directory to understand the project structure
2. Follow the established patterns when adding new features
3. Update context files when making significant changes
4. Keep documentation up to date with code changes
