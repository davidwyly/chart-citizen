# test-orbit-spacing Context

This directory contains a visual demo page that demonstrates the orbital path spacing differences between the three view modes (realistic, navigational, and profile) in the chart-citizen application.

- `page.tsx` - Interactive page that lets users switch between view modes and visualize how orbital paths are arranged differently in each mode. Includes a diagrammatic representation of orbital path spacing at the top and an actual SystemViewer component showing the real implementation.
