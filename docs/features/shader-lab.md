# Shader Lab

## User Story
As a developer, I want to experiment with and craft custom shaders for celestial objects in the chart-citizen application, so that I can create visually stunning and accurate representations of stars, planets, and other astronomical phenomena.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The shader lab should provide access to all celestial object types (stars, planets, moons, black holes)
2. Each object should display real-time shader parameters that can be modified
3. Shader quality settings should be adjustable to test performance impacts
4. Objects should be viewable from multiple angles with orbit controls
5. Material properties should be editable including colors, intensity, distortion, and speed
6. Changes should be reflected in real-time
7. The viewer should include wireframe and bounding box toggles for debugging
8. The shader lab should be accessible from any page via a fixed button in the bottom right corner

## Implementation Strategy
1. Leverage the existing object viewer and debug tools components
2. Create a catalog of celestial object types with default shader parameters
3. Implement real-time shader uniform updates based on user input
4. Build a user interface that exposes key shader parameters
5. Add performance monitoring for shader efficiency testing
6. Include navigation between different object types
7. Add global application access via layout component

## Testing Approach
1. Unit tests for:
   - Parameter binding to shader uniforms
   - User interface controls functionality 
   - Object rendering with different parameters
   - Navigation between object types
2. Visual regression tests to ensure shader consistency
3. Performance benchmarks at different quality levels

## Usage Example
The shader lab can be accessed via the "Shader Lab" button in the bottom right corner of any page. From there, developers can select different celestial objects and experiment with their shader parameters to create custom visual effects.
