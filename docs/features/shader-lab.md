# Shader Lab

## User Story
Experiment with and craft custom shaders for celestial objects to create visually stunning and accurate representations.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Provides access to all celestial object types (stars, planets, moons, black holes).
2. Each object displays real-time, modifiable shader parameters.
3. Shader quality settings adjustable for performance testing.
4. Objects viewable from multiple angles with orbit controls.
5. Material properties editable (colors, intensity, distortion, speed).
6. Changes reflected in real-time.
7. Viewer includes wireframe/bounding box toggles for debugging.
8. Accessible from any page via fixed bottom-right button.

## Implementation Strategy
1. Leverage existing celestial viewer and debug tools.
2. Create catalog of celestial object types with default shader parameters.
3. Implement real-time shader uniform updates based on user input.
4. Build UI exposing key shader parameters.
5. Add performance monitoring for shader efficiency.
6. Include navigation between object types.
7. Add global application access via layout component.

## Testing Approach
1. Unit tests for:
   - Parameter binding to shader uniforms.
   - UI controls functionality.
   - Object rendering with different parameters.
   - Navigation between object types.
2. Visual regression tests for shader consistency.
3. Performance benchmarks at different quality levels.

## Usage Example
Accessed via "Shader Lab" button (bottom right). Select objects, experiment with shader parameters for custom visual effects.
