# Star Rendering Features

## Overview
Realistic visualization of star types, surface features, atmospheric effects, and dynamic behaviors.

## Core Features

### Star Types
- Main sequence stars
- Red dwarf stars
- Variable stars
- Each type has unique visual characteristics/behaviors.

### Visual Effects

#### Corona Effect
- Dynamic outer atmosphere visualization.
- 2D sprite-based for performance.
- Proper z-ordering to prevent artifacts.
- Distance-based scaling.
- Animated appearance based on star properties.

#### Solar Prominences
- Plasma loop visualization.
- Particle system-based implementation.
- Dynamic movement and evolution.
- Color variations based on temperature.
- Scale-appropriate rendering.

### Performance Optimizations
- Instance-based rendering for multiple stars.
- Distance-based level of detail.
- Shader optimizations.
- Texture management.
- View mode-specific optimizations.

## Implementation Details

### Corona Rendering
```typescript
// Key aspects of corona rendering
- Positioned in front of star to prevent z-fighting
- Scales based on star radius and distance
- Uses custom shader for dynamic effects
- Supports different view modes
```

### Solar Prominences
```typescript
// Key aspects of prominence rendering
- Particle system for dynamic movement
- Temperature-based color variations
- Scale-appropriate detail levels
- Performance optimizations for multiple instances
```

## View Mode Support
- Realistic: Full detail, accurate scaling.
- Navigational: Simplified effects, enhanced visibility.
- Profile: Focused on specific features.

## Future Enhancements
1. More star types and variations
2. Enhanced atmospheric effects
3. Improved performance optimizations
4. Additional visual effects
5. Better integration with view modes
