# Black Hole Rendering

## User Story
As a user, I want to view realistic black holes with gravitational lensing and accretion disks, so I can explore the extreme phenomena of the universe.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The application renders black holes with a visible gravitational lensing effect on background stars and nebulae.
- An accretion disk with appropriate Doppler shift and redshift effects is rendered around the black hole.
- The black hole rendering is performant and visually convincing.

## High-Level Implementation Strategy
- Utilize a custom `BlackHoleMaterial` and `BlackHoleRenderer` to implement the visual effects.
- Implement a sphere geometry with world-space ray calculation for accurate 3D rotation and lensing.
- Incorporate procedural textures and shaders for the accretion disk and background starfield.

## High-Level Testing Approach
- Unit tests for `BlackHoleMaterial` and `BlackHoleRenderer` to verify lensing calculations and material properties.
- Visual regression tests to confirm the appearance of the lensing effect and accretion disk under various camera angles.
- Performance tests to ensure rendering efficiency, especially when multiple black holes are present.
