# Gas Giant Rendering

## User Story
View realistic gas giant planets with atmospheric bands and storm systems.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Renders gas giant planets with distinct atmospheric banding.
- Visible, animated storm systems (e.g., Great Red Spot-like feature).
- Dynamically lit by nearby stars.
- Performant and visually appealing rendering.

## High-Level Implementation Strategy
- Custom `GasGiantMaterial` and `GasGiantRenderer` for specialized visual effects.
- Procedural texture generation for atmospheric bands and storm systems within renderer.
- Proper handling of light direction from stellar objects.

## High-Level Testing Approach
- Unit tests for `GasGiantMaterial`/`GasGiantRenderer` (texture generation, lighting, animation).
- Visual regression tests (atmospheric bands, storm systems appearance).
- Performance tests (rendering efficiency with multiple gas giants).
