# Gas Giant Rendering

## User Story
As a user, I want to view realistic gas giant planets with atmospheric bands and storm systems, so I can appreciate the diverse celestial bodies in the simulated universe.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The application renders gas giant planets with distinct atmospheric banding.
- Visible storm systems (e.g., a Great Red Spot-like feature) are present and animated.
- The gas giants are dynamically lit by nearby stars.
- The rendering is performant and visually appealing.

## High-Level Implementation Strategy
- Utilize a custom `GasGiantMaterial` and `GasGiantRenderer` to achieve specialized visual effects.
- Implement procedural texture generation for atmospheric bands and storm systems within the renderer.
- Ensure proper handling of light direction from stellar objects to illuminate the gas giant.

## High-Level Testing Approach
- Unit tests for `GasGiantMaterial` and `GasGiantRenderer` to verify texture generation, lighting, and animation.
- Visual regression tests to confirm the appearance of atmospheric bands and storm systems.
- Performance tests to ensure rendering efficiency with multiple gas giants.
