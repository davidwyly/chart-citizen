# Interaction System Features

## Overview
Intuitive, responsive interaction with celestial objects (selection, navigation, information display).

## Core Features

### Object Interaction
- Hover detection/highlighting
- Click selection
- Focus management
- Custom interaction behaviors
- Performance optimizations

### Camera Controls
- Orbit controls
- Zoom functionality
- Pan movement
- View mode-specific behaviors
- Smooth transitions

### UI Feedback
- Object highlighting
- Selection indicators
- Information overlays
- Navigation breadcrumbs
- Loading states

## Implementation Details

### Interactive Objects
```typescript
// Key aspects of interactive objects
- Event handling system
- Performance optimizations
