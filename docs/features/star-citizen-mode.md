# Star Citizen Mode

## User Story
As a user, I want to view star systems inspired by the Star Citizen game, so I can explore a familiar universe with unique visual and navigational characteristics.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The application loads and displays star systems with visual elements reminiscent of the Star Citizen game.
- Navigational controls are adapted to the Star Citizen mode's specific characteristics.
- The mode can be seamlessly switched from other view modes.

## High-Level Implementation Strategy
- Create a dedicated React component `StarCitizenModeView` that encapsulates the rendering and logic for this mode.
- Integrate Star Citizen specific assets and shaders.
- Adjust camera and orbital mechanics to align with the Star Citizen universe.

## High-Level Testing Approach
- Unit tests for `StarCitizenModeView` to ensure correct rendering and interaction.
- Integration tests to verify seamless mode switching and data loading.
- Visual regression tests to confirm the visual fidelity of Star Citizen specific elements.
