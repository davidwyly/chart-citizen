# Star Citizen Mode

## User Story
View star systems inspired by the Star Citizen game, exploring a familiar universe with unique visual and navigational characteristics.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Loads and displays star systems with Star Citizen-reminiscent visual elements.
- Navigational controls adapted to Star Citizen mode's characteristics.
- Seamless mode switching from other view modes.

## High-Level Implementation Strategy
- Dedicated `StarCitizenModeView` React component for rendering/logic.
- Integrate Star Citizen-specific assets and shaders.
- Adjust camera/orbital mechanics to Star Citizen universe.

## High-Level Testing Approach
- Unit tests for `StarCitizenModeView` (rendering/interaction).
- Integration tests (seamless mode switching, data loading).
- Visual regression tests (visual fidelity of Star Citizen elements).
