# Engine State Management

## Overview
The Engine State Management system provides a centralized way to manage the 3D engine's state, configuration, and scene management. It uses Zustand for state management and provides a clean API for controlling the engine's lifecycle.

## User Story
As a developer, I want to manage the 3D engine's state, configuration, and scenes in a centralized way, so that I can easily control the engine's behavior and maintain a consistent state across the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Engine state can be initialized, started, and stopped
2. Configuration can be updated at runtime
3. Scenes can be added, removed, and switched
4. Error states are properly handled and reported
5. State changes are predictable and testable

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### Engine Store (`engine-state.ts`)
- Manages engine state and configuration
- Handles scene management
- Controls engine lifecycle
- Provides error handling

#### Types (`types.ts`)
- Defines interfaces for:
  - Engine state
  - Engine configuration
  - Scene configuration
  - Object properties

### Key Features

#### Configuration Management
```typescript
const store = useEngineStore();
store.setConfig({ debug: true, maxFPS: 30 });
```

#### Scene Management
```typescript
const store = useEngineStore();
store.addScene({
  name: 'main-scene',
  objects: [],
  lighting: {
    ambient: { color: '#ffffff', intensity: 1 },
    directional: { color: '#ffffff', intensity: 1, position: [0, 1, 0] }
  }
});
store.setCurrentScene('main-scene');
```

#### Engine Control
```typescript
const store = useEngineStore();
await store.initialize();
store.start();
// ... later
store.stop();
```

#### Error Handling
```typescript
const store = useEngineStore();
store.setError('Failed to load scene');
// ... later
store.setError(null);
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Configuration management
- Scene management
- Engine lifecycle
- Error handling
- State transitions

### Integration Tests
- Engine initialization
- Scene loading
- Configuration updates
- Error recovery

## Performance Considerations
- State updates should be optimized
- Scene switching should be smooth
- Configuration changes should be efficient
- Error handling should not impact performance

## Security Considerations
- Scene data should be validated
- Configuration changes should be sanitized
- Error messages should not expose sensitive information

## Future Enhancements
1. Scene preloading
2. Configuration presets
3. State persistence
4. Performance monitoring
5. Advanced error recovery
