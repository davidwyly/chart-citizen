# Planet Rings

## User Story
As a user, I want to view realistic planetary ring systems around celestial bodies, so I can observe the intricate details of gas giants and other ringed planets.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The application renders planetary ring systems with appropriate thickness and density variations.
- The rings are dynamically lit by nearby stars, showing shadows and highlights.
- The rendering is visually appealing and performant.

## High-Level Implementation Strategy
- Develop a dedicated `PlanetRingsRenderer` component to handle the geometry and material of the ring systems.
- Implement procedural generation or texture mapping for ring density and patterns.
- Ensure proper integration with the lighting system to accurately represent illumination.

## High-Level Testing Approach
- Unit tests for `PlanetRingsRenderer` to verify geometry creation and material application.
- Visual regression tests to confirm the appearance of ring systems under different lighting conditions.
- Performance tests to ensure efficient rendering of complex ring structures.
