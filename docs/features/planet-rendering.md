# Planet Rendering Features

## Overview
Detailed visualization of planet types, surface features, atmospheric effects, and dynamic behaviors.

## Core Features

### Planet Types
- Terrestrial planets
- Gas giants
- Ice planets
- Volcanic planets
- Ocean planets
- Each type has unique visual characteristics/behaviors.

### Visual Effects

#### Atmospheric Effects
- Dynamic cloud systems
- Storm visualization
- Atmospheric scattering
- Color variations based on composition
- Scale-appropriate rendering

#### Surface Features
- Terrain visualization
- Ocean rendering
- Volcanic activity with dynamic lava flows
- Ice caps and glaciers
- Scale-appropriate detail levels

### Performance Optimizations
- Instance-based rendering for multiple planets
- Distance-based level of detail
- Shader optimizations
- Texture management
- View mode-specific optimizations
