# Toast Notifications

## User Story
As a user, I want to receive clear and timely notifications about application events (e.g., successful operations, errors, warnings), so I can stay informed without interrupting my workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The application displays temporary, non-intrusive notification messages.
- Notifications can have different types (e.g., success, error, info) with corresponding visual cues.
- Users can dismiss notifications, and they automatically disappear after a set time.
- Multiple notifications can be queued and displayed in a controlled manner.

## High-Level Implementation Strategy
- Implement a `useToast` React hook that manages the state and logic for toast notifications.
- Utilize a reducer pattern to handle `ADD_TOAST`, `UPDATE_TOAST`, `DISMISS_TOAST`, and `REMOVE_TOAST` actions.
- Integrate with a UI component library (e.g., shadcn/ui's `Toast` component) for visual rendering.
- Implement a queueing mechanism to limit the number of visible toasts and a timeout for auto-dismissal.

## High-Level Testing Approach
- Unit tests for the `reducer` function to ensure correct state transitions for all toast actions.
- Unit tests for the `useToast` hook to verify toast creation, updating, dismissal, and automatic removal.
- Integration tests to confirm that toast notifications appear and disappear correctly in response to application events.
- Visual regression tests to ensure consistent styling and placement of different toast types.
