## üìä **Implementation Guidelines**

### **Testing Strategy by Phase:**
- **Phase 1-2**: Unit tests (90% coverage) + Manual testing
- **Phase 3-4**: Integration tests + Performance benchmarks
- **Phase 5-6**: Accessibility tests + Mobile device testing
- **Phase 7-8**: End-to-end tests + User acceptance testing

### **Performance Targets:**
- **60fps** with 1000+ systems
- **<200MB** memory usage
- **<100ms** pathfinding for complex routes
- **<800ms** view mode transitions

### **Quality Gates:**
Each phase must pass before proceeding:
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated

### **Risk Mitigation:**
- Start with minimal viable features in each phase
- Implement fallbacks for complex features
- Test on low-end devices early
- Get user feedback after Phase 4

This phased approach ensures steady progress while maintaining quality and allows for early user feedback to guide later phases.

## üéØ **Quick Start Recommendation**

**If you want to start implementing immediately, begin with Phase 1:**

1. **Day 1**: Create the directory structure and basic type definitions
2. **Day 2**: Implement `HexCoordinate` class with unit tests
3. **Day 3**: Create `StarmapSystem` and `JumpRoute` interfaces
4. **Day 4**: Build data loading service
5. **Day 5**: Test with existing realistic mode data

This gives you a solid foundation to build upon and immediate validation that your approach works with the existing data structure.
