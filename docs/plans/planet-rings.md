# Planet Rings

## User Story
View realistic planetary ring systems around celestial bodies to observe intricate details of gas giants and other ringed planets.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Renders planetary ring systems with appropriate thickness/density variations.
- Rings dynamically lit by nearby stars, showing shadows/highlights.
- Visually appealing and performant rendering.

## High-Level Implementation Strategy
- Dedicated `PlanetRingsRenderer` component for geometry/material.
- Procedural generation or texture mapping for ring density/patterns.
- Proper integration with lighting system for accurate illumination.

## High-Level Testing Approach
- Unit tests for `PlanetRingsRenderer` (geometry creation, material application).
- Visual regression tests (ring system appearance under different lighting).
- Performance tests (efficient rendering of complex ring structures).
