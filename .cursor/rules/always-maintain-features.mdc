**Rule: Always Maintain Feature Documentation for Testable Functionality**

Each testable feature in the application should be documented in a dedicated feature.md file located in the docs/features/ directory.

Rules:
1. When a new testable feature is requested, create a feature.md file for it in docs/features/.
2. Each feature.md file should include:
 - A clear user story
 - Unambiguous acceptance criteria
 - A high-level implementation strategy
 - A high-level testing approach
3. At the root of the docs/features/ folder, maintain a features-summary.md file.
 - This file should contain a one-sentence summary of each feature, and 
 - The name of its corresponding markdown document
4. When adding a new feature document, update features.md with its summary and filename.
5. When removing or fundamentally changing a feature, update or remove the corresponding entry in features-summary.md accordingly.

These documents are critical for test planning, understanding application behavior, and ensuring that essential features remain intact during large-scale changes or refactors.

Before moving or modifying unfamiliar functionality, consult features-summary.md. If a related feature is listed, review its associated feature.md document to understand the context and plan your changes accordingly.
