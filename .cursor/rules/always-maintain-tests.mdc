Test Maintenance for Code Changes

When editing a file that has associated tests, ensure that those tests are updated to reflect the changes.

Rules:
1. If the file being modified has accompanying tests, update them to stay aligned with the new behavior or structure.
2. Add new test cases when new functionality is introduced.
3. Modify test cases when functionality is changed.
4. Remove or revise outdated tests when functionality is removed or significantly changed.
5. Do not leave broken or irrelevant tests in placeâ€”test coverage should accurately reflect current functionality.


Maintaining reliable tests is essential for preventing regressions and preserving feature integrity as the codebase evolves. Always treat tests as first-class citizens during development and refactoring.
