Context Files for Project Structure

Each directory in the project should contain a context.md file at its root. This file provides a one-sentence contextual summary of each file in that folderâ€”what it does and why it exists.

Rules: 
1. When creating a new file in a folder, add a one-sentence summary to that folder's context.md.
2. When deleting a file, remove its corresponding summary from context.md.
3. When creating a new folder, generate a blank context.md inside it.
4. When a file's purpose or behavior fundamentally changes, update its summary in context.md to reflect the new context.
5. Evaluate the folder context for every file being deleted or modified.

These context.md files are used to maintain high-level awareness of the role and purpose of each file across the codebase, especially helpful during onboarding, code reviews, and refactors.

When refactoring or reorganizing code, refer to the relevant context.md in a folder to understand what each file is for. If a files purpose isn't clear or the summary seems outdated, investigate and update accordingly.
