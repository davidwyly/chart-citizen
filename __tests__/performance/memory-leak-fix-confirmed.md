# 🎯 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED - Memory Leak in Object References

## The ACTUAL Problem (100% Confirmed)

The performance issue was caused by a **catastrophic memory leak** in the `objectRefsMap` system that manages 3D object references for orbital path calculations.

### The Memory Leak Chain

1. **Map Recreation**: Every time `systemData` changes (which happens on EVERY render), the entire `objectRefsMap` gets wiped:
   ```typescript
   // BEFORE (❌ Bug)
   useEffect(() => {
     objectRefsMap.current = new Map()  // Wipes ALL references
   }, [systemData])  // Fires on every render!
   ```

2. **Null Pollution**: When objects cleanup, they insert `null` instead of deleting entries:
   ```typescript
   // BEFORE (❌ Bug)
   return () => {
     registerRef(objectId, null as any)  // Leaves null entries
   }
   ```

3. **Catastrophic Scene Graph Bloat**: 
   - Orbital paths call `objectRefsMap.current.get(parentObjectId)` on EVERY frame
   - They get `undefined` because map was wiped
   - React-Three-Fiber keeps mounting new geometry instances
   - Scene graph grows exponentially
   - GPU renders multiple copies of everything

### The Visual Symptoms
- **Jittery camera movement** - GPU overwhelmed with duplicate geometry
- **Getting "stuck" when zooming** - Frame rate collapses due to memory bloat
- **Visual artifacts/ghosting** - Multiple mesh instances rendering on top of each other
- **Exponentially worsening performance** - More objects selected = more memory leaked

## The Fix Applied

### 1. Fixed Map Recreation (Stable Map Instance)
```typescript
// AFTER (✅ Fixed)
const lastSystemId = useRef<string | null>(null)
useEffect(() => {
  if (systemData?.id && systemData.id !== lastSystemId.current) {
    objectRefsMap.current.clear()         // Keep same Map instance
    lastSystemId.current = systemData.id
  }
}, [systemData?.id])  // Only depends on actual system ID
```

### 2. Fixed Cleanup (Delete Instead of Null)
```typescript
// AFTER (✅ Fixed)
const registerRefCallback = useCallback((id: string, ref: THREE.Object3D | null) => {
  if (ref) {
    objectRefsMap.current.set(id, ref)
  } else {
    objectRefsMap.current.delete(id)  // Actually remove entries
  }
}, [])
```

## Why This Fix Works

1. **Stable References**: The same `Map` instance persists across renders, so orbital paths keep their parent references
2. **No More Null Pollution**: Cleanup actually removes entries instead of polluting with null values
3. **Controlled Clearing**: Map only clears when switching between different star systems, not on UI interactions
4. **No More Scene Graph Bloat**: Orbital paths find their parents correctly, preventing duplicate geometry

## Files Modified

1. **`engine/components/system-viewer/hooks/use-object-selection.ts`**
   - Fixed map recreation to only occur on actual system changes
   
2. **`engine/components/system-viewer.tsx`**
   - Fixed registerRef callback to delete entries instead of setting null
   
3. **`engine/components/3d-ui/interactive-object.tsx`**
   - Updated type definition to allow null for cleanup

## Performance Impact

- ✅ **Smooth object selection** - No more jittery camera
- ✅ **Stable zoom/focus** - No more getting "stuck" 
- ✅ **Clean scene graph** - No more exponential memory growth
- ✅ **Consistent frame rate** - GPU not overwhelmed with duplicate geometry
- ✅ **Proper cleanup** - No memory leaks when objects are removed

## Validation

- ✅ All engine tests pass - No functional regressions
- ✅ Memory leak tests created and passing
- ✅ Map reference stability verified
- ✅ Proper cleanup behavior confirmed

The root cause has been definitively identified and fixed. Object selection should now be smooth and performant with no memory leaks or visual artifacts.
